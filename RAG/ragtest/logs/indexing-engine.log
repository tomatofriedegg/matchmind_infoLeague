ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that is capable of generating human-like text.\n\nHowever, it is vital to understand the right way to ask ChatGPT in order to get the high-quality outputs we desire.\n\nAnd that is the purpose of this book. Whether you are a normal person, a researcher, a developer, or simply someone who wants to use ChatGPT as his personal assistant in your field, this book is written for you.\n\nI have used simple language with on-point practical explanations, together with examples and prompt formulas on every prompt technique. With this book, you\'ll learn how to use prompt engineering techniques to control the output of ChatGPT and generate text that is tailored to your specific needs.\n\nThroughout this book, we also provide examples of how to combine different prompt techniques to achieve more specific outcomes.\n\n\n\nI hope that you will find this book informative and enjoyable as much as I enjoyed writing it.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering Techniques\n\nWhat is Prompt engineering?\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of creating prompts or asking or instructions that guide the output of a language model like ChatGPT. It allows users to control the output of the model and generate text that is tailored to their specific needs.\n\nChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that is capable of generating human-like text. It is built on the transformer architecture, which allows it to handle large amounts of data and generate high-quality text.\n\nHowever, in order to get the best results from ChatGPT, it is important to understand how to properly prompt the model.\n\nPrompting allows users to control the output of the model and generate text that is relevant, accurate, and of high-quality.\n\nWhen working with ChatGPT, it is important to understand its capabilities and limitations.\n\nThe model is capable of generating human-like text, but it may not always produce the desired output without proper guidance.\n\nThis is where prompt engineering comes in, by providing clear and specific instructions, you can guide the model\'s output and ensure that it is relevant.\n\nA prompt formula is a specific format for the prompt, it is generally composed of 3 main elements:\n\ntask: a clear and concise statement of what the prompt is asking the model to generate.\n\ninstructions: the instructions that should be followed by the model when generating text.\n\nrole: the role that the model should take on when generating text.\n\nIn this book, we will explore the various prompt engineering techniques that can be used with ChatGPT. We will discuss the\n\ndifferent types of prompts, as well as how to use them to achieve specific goals you want.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Instructions Prompt Technique Now, let us start by exploring the “instructions prompt technique”\n\nand how it can be used to generate high-quality text from ChatGPT.\n\nThe instructions prompt technique is a way of guiding the output of ChatGPT by providing specific instructions for the model to follow.\n\nThis technique is useful for ensuring that the output is relevant and high-quality.\n\nTo use the instructions prompt technique, you will need to provide a clear and concise task for the model, as well as specific instructions for the model to follow.\n\nFor example, if you are generating customer service responses, you would provide a task such as "generate responses to customer inquiries" and instructions such as "responses should be professional and provide accurate information".\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate [task] following these instructions:\n\n[instructions]"\n\nExamples:\n\nGenerating customer service responses:\n\nTask: Generate\n######################\nOutput:', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'gpt-4-turbo-preview', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 4000, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

This will help to ensure that the output is relevant and high-quality. The instructions prompt technique can be combined together with “role prompting” and “seed-word prompting” as explained in the next chapter to enhance the output of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Role Prompting\n\nThe role prompting technique is a way of guiding the output of ChatGPT by providing a specific role for the model to take on. This technique is useful for generating text that is tailored to a specific context or audience.\n\nTo use the role prompting technique, you will need to provide a clear and specific role for the model to take on. For example, if you are generating customer service responses, you would provide a role such as "customer service representative".\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate [task] as a [role]"\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating customer service responses:\n\nTask: Generate responses to customer inquiries Role: Customer service representative\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate responses to customer inquiries as a customer service representative."\n\nGenerating a legal document:\n\nTask: Generate a legal document\n\nRole: Lawyer\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a legal document as a lawyer."\n\nUsing the role prompting technique with instruction prompting and seed-word prompting will enhance the output of ChatGPT.\n\nHere is an example of how the instruction prompting, role prompting, and seed-word prompting techniques can be combined: Task: Generate a product description for a new smartphone Instructions: The description should be informative, persuasive and highlight the unique features of the smartphone\n\nRole: Marketing representative\n\nSeed-word: "innovative"\n\nPrompt formula: "As a marketing representative, generate an informative, persuasive product description that highlights the innovative features of the new smartphone. The smartphone has the following features [insert your features]”\n\nIn this example, the instruction prompting is used to ensure that the product description is informative and persuasive. The role prompting is used to ensure that the description is written from the perspective of a marketing representative. And the seed-word prompting is used to ensure that the description focuses on the innovative features of the smartphone.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Standard Prompts\n\nStandard prompts are a simple way to guide the output of ChatGPT by providing a specific task for the model to complete.\n\nFor example, if you want to generate a summary of a news article, you would provide a task such as "summarize this news article".\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a [task]"\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating a summary of a news article:\n\nTask: Summarize this news article\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a summary of this news article"\n\n\n\nGenerating a product review:\n\nTask: Write a review of a new smartphone\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a review of this new smartphone"\n\nAlso, Standard prompts can be combined with other techniques like role prompting and seed-word prompting to enhance the output of ChatGPT.\n\nHere is an example of how the standard prompts, role prompting, and seed-word prompting techniques can be combined: Task: Generate a product review for a new laptop Instructions: The review should be objective, informative and highlight the unique features of the laptop\n\nRole: Tech expert\n\nSeed-word: "powerful"\n\nPrompt formula: "As a tech expert, generate an objective and informative product review that highlights the powerful features of the new laptop."\n\nIn this example, the standard prompts technique is used to ensure that the model generates a product review. The role prompting is used to ensure that the review is written from the perspective of a tech expert. And the seedword prompting is used to ensure that the review focuses on the powerful features of the laptop.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Zero, One and Few Shot Prompting Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting are techniques used to generate text from ChatGPT with minimal or no examples. These techniques are useful when there is limited data available for a specific task or when the task is new and not well-defined.\n\nThe zero-shot prompting technique is used when there are no examples available for the task. The model is provided with a general task and it generates text based on its understanding of the task.\n\nThe one-shot prompting technique is used when there is only one example available for the task. The model is provided with the example and generates text based on its understanding of the example.\n\nThe few-shot prompting technique is used when there are a limited number of examples available for the task. The model is provided with the examples and generates text based on its understanding of the examples.\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate text based on [number] examples"\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating a product description for a new product with no examples available:\n\nTask: Write a product description for a new smartwatch Prompt formula: "Generate a product description for this new smartwatch with zero examples"\n\nGenerating a product comparison with one example available:\n\nTask: Compare a new smartphone to the latest iPhone Prompt formula: "Generate a product comparison of this new smartphone with one\n######################\nOutput:', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'gpt-4-turbo-preview', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 4000, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

This technique is useful for tasks such as writing essays, poetry, or creative writing.\n\nThe prompt formula for the "Let\'s think about this" prompt is simply the phrase "Let\'s think about this" followed by a topic or question.\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating a reflective essay:\n\nTask: Write a reflective essay on the topic of personal growth Prompt formula: "Let\'s think about this: personal growth"\n\nGenerating a poem:\n\nTask: Write a poem about the changing seasons\n\nPrompt formula: "Let\'s think about this: the changing seasons"\n\nThis prompt is asking for a conversation or discussion about a specific topic or idea. The speaker is inviting ChatGPT to engage in a dialogue about the subject at hand.\n\nThe model is provided with a prompt, which serves as the starting point for the conversation or text generation.\n\nThe model then uses its training data and algorithms to generate a response that is relevant to the prompt. This technique allows ChatGPT to generate contextually appropriate and coherent text based on the provided prompt.\n\nTo use the "Let’s think about this prompt" technique with ChatGPT, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.\n\nIdentify the topic or idea you want to discuss.\n\n2.\n\nFormulate a prompt that clearly states the topic or idea, and starts the conversation or text generation.\n\n3.\n\nPreface the prompt with "Let\'s think about" or "Let\'s discuss"\n\nto indicate that you\'re initiating a conversation or discussion.\n\nHere are a few examples of prompts using this technique: Prompt: "Let\'s think about the impact of climate change on agriculture"\n\nPrompt: "Let\'s discuss the current state of artificial intelligence"\n\nPrompt: "Let\'s talk about the benefits and drawbacks of remote work"\n\nYou can also add a open-ended question, statement or a piece of text that you want the model to continue or build upon.\n\nOnce you provide the prompt, the model will use its training data and algorithms to generate a response that is relevant to the prompt and will continue the conversation in a coherent way.\n\nThis unique prompt helps ChatGPT to give answers in different perspectives and angles, resulting in more dynamic and informative passages.\n\nThe steps to use the prompt are simple and easy to follow, and it can truly make a difference in your writing. Give it a try and see for yourself\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7: Self-Consistency Prompt The Self-Consistency prompt is a technique used to ensure that the output of ChatGPT is consistent with the input provided. This technique is useful for tasks such as fact-checking, data validation, or consistency checking in text generation.\n\nThe prompt formula for the Self-Consistency prompt is the input text followed by the instruction "Please ensure the following text is self-consistent"\n\nAlternatively, the model can be prompted to generate text that is consistent with the provided input.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text Generation\n\nTask: Generate a product review\n\nInstructions: The review should be consistent with the product information provided in the input\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a product review that is consistent with the following product information [insert product information]"\n\nExample 2: Text Summarization\n\nTask: Summarize a news article\n\nInstructions: The summary should be consistent with the information provided in the article\n\nPrompt formula: "Summarize the following news article in a way that is consistent with the information provided [insert news article]"\n\nExample 3: Text Completion\n\nTask: Complete a sentence\n\nInstructions: The completion should be consistent with the context provided in the input\n\nPrompt formula: "Complete the following sentence in a way that is consistent with the context provided [insert sentence]"\n\nExample 4:\n\n1.\n\nFact-checking:\n\nTask: Check for consistency in a given news article Input text: "The article states that the population of the city is 5 million, but later on, it says that the population is 7 million."\n\nPrompt formula: "Please ensure the following text is self-consistent: The article states that the population of the city is 5 million, but later on, it says that the population is 7 million."\n\n\n\n2.\n\nData validation:\n\nTask: Check for consistency in a given data set Input text: "The data shows that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, but the minimum temperature is recorded as 20 degrees."\n\nPrompt formula: "Please ensure the following text is self-consistent: The data shows that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, but the minimum temperature is recorded as 20 degrees."\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Seed-word Prompt\n\nThe Seed-word prompt is a technique used to control the output of ChatGPT by providing it with a specific seed-word or phrase.\n\nThe prompt formula for the Seed-word prompt is the seed-word or phrase followed by the instruction "Please generate text based on the following seed-word"\n\nExamples:\n\nText generation:\n\nTask: Generate a story about a dragon\n\nSeed\n######################\nOutput:', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'gpt-4-turbo-preview', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 4000, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

This technique is useful for tasks such as natural language processing, text analytics, and sentiment analysis.\n\nIt\'s important to note that Text classification is different from sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis specifically focus on determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in text.\n\nThis could include determining whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Sentiment analysis is often used in the context of customer reviews, social media posts, and other forms of text where the sentiment expressed is important.\n\nTo use text classification prompts with ChatGPT, the model should be provided with a piece of text and asked to classify it based on predefined categories or labels. The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the number of classes or categories, and any specific requirements or constraints.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text classification of customer reviews Task: Classify customer reviews into different categories such as electronics, clothing and furniture\n\nInstructions: The model should classify the reviews based on their content\n\nPrompt formula: "Perform text classification on the following customer reviews [insert reviews] and classify them into different categories such as electronics, clothing and furniture based on their content."\n\nExample 2: Text classification of news articles Task: Classify news articles into different categories such as sports, politics, and entertainment\n\nInstructions: The model should classify the articles based on their content\n\nPrompt formula: "Perform text classification on the following news articles [insert articles] and classify them into different categories such as sports, politics, and entertainment based on their content."\n\nExample 3: Text classification of emails\n\nTask: Classify emails into different categories such as spam, important, or urgent\n\nInstructions: The model should classify the emails based on their content and sender\n\nPrompt formula: "Perform text classification on the following emails [insert emails] and classify them into different categories such as spam, important, or urgent based on their content and sender."\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 24: Text generation prompts Text generation prompts are related to several other prompt techniques mentioned in this book, such as: Zero, One and Few Shot Prompting, Controlled generation prompts, Translation prompts, Language modeling prompts, Sentence completion prompts.\n\nAll these prompts are related because they all involve generating text, but they differ in the way the text is generated and the specific requirements or constraints that are placed on the generated text.\n\nText generation prompts can be used to fine-tune a pre-trained model or to train a new model for specific tasks.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text generation for story writing\n\nTask: Generate a story based on a given prompt Instructions: The story should be at least 1000 words and include a specific set of characters and a plot Prompt formula: "Generate a story of at least 1000 words, including characters [insert characters] and a plot [insert plot]\n\nbased on the following prompt [insert prompt]."\n\nExample 2: Text generation for language translation Task: Translate a given text into another language Instructions: The translation should be accurate and idiomatic Prompt formula: "Translate the following text [insert text] into\n\n[insert target language] and make sure that it is accurate and idiomatic."\n\nExample 3: Text generation for text completion Task: Complete a given text\n\nInstructions: The generated text should be coherent and consistent with the input text\n\nPrompt formula: "Complete the following text [insert text] and make sure that it is coherent and consistent with the input text."Chapter 26: Word prediction prompts\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we\'ve explored throughout this book, prompt engineering is a powerful tool to get high-quality answers from language models like ChatGPT. By carefully crafting prompts that incorporate various techniques, we can guide the model to generate text that is tailored to our specific needs and requirements.\n\nIn chapter 2, we looked at how instructions prompts can be used to provide clear and specific guidance to the model. In chapter 3, we explored how role prompts can be used to generate text in a specific voice or style. In chapter 4, we examined how standard prompts can be used as a starting point for fine-tuning the model\'s performance.\n\nWe also looked at several advanced prompt techniques such as Zero, One and Few Shot Prompting, Self-Consistency, Seed-word Prompt, Knowledge Generation prompt, Knowledge Integration prompts, Multiple Choice prompts, Interpretable Soft Prompts, Controlled generation prompts, Question-answering prompts, Summarization prompts, Dialogue prompts, Adversarial prompts, Clustering prompts, Reinforcement learning prompts, Curriculum learning prompts, Sentiment analysis prompts, Named entity recognition prompts, and Text classification prompts Each of these techniques can be used in different ways to\n######################\nOutput:', 'role': 'user'}], 'model': 'gpt-4-turbo-preview', 'frequency_penalty': 0.0, 'max_tokens': 4000, 'n': 1, 'presence_penalty': 0.0, 'temperature': 0.0, 'top_p': 1.0}}

This technique is useful for tasks such as natural language processing, text analytics, and sentiment analysis.\n\nIt\'s important to note that Text classification is different from sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis specifically focus on determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in text.\n\nThis could include determining whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Sentiment analysis is often used in the context of customer reviews, social media posts, and other forms of text where the sentiment expressed is important.\n\nTo use text classification prompts with ChatGPT, the model should be provided with a piece of text and asked to classify it based on predefined categories or labels. The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the number of classes or categories, and any specific requirements or constraints.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text classification of customer reviews Task: Classify customer reviews into different categories such as electronics, clothing and furniture\n\nInstructions: The model should classify the reviews based on their content\n\nPrompt formula: "Perform text classification on the following customer reviews [insert reviews] and classify them into different categories such as electronics, clothing and furniture based on their content."\n\nExample 2: Text classification of news articles Task: Classify news articles into different categories such as sports, politics, and entertainment\n\nInstructions: The model should classify the articles based on their content\n\nPrompt formula: "Perform text classification on the following news articles [insert articles] and classify them into different categories such as sports, politics, and entertainment based on their content."\n\nExample 3: Text classification of emails\n\nTask: Classify emails into different categories such as spam, important, or urgent\n\nInstructions: The model should classify the emails based on their content and sender\n\nPrompt formula: "Perform text classification on the following emails [insert emails] and classify them into different categories such as spam, important, or urgent based on their content and sender."\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 24: Text generation prompts Text generation prompts are related to several other prompt techniques mentioned in this book, such as: Zero, One and Few Shot Prompting, Controlled generation prompts, Translation prompts, Language modeling prompts, Sentence completion prompts.\n\nAll these prompts are related because they all involve generating text, but they differ in the way the text is generated and the specific requirements or constraints that are placed on the generated text.\n\nText generation prompts can be used to fine-tune a pre-trained model or to train a new model for specific tasks.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text generation for story writing\n\nTask: Generate a story based on a given prompt Instructions: The story should be at least 1000 words and include a specific set of characters and a plot Prompt formula: "Generate a story of at least 1000 words, including characters [insert characters] and a plot [insert plot]\n\nbased on the following prompt [insert prompt]."\n\nExample 2: Text generation for language translation Task: Translate a given text into another language Instructions: The translation should be accurate and idiomatic Prompt formula: "Translate the following text [insert text] into\n\n[insert target language] and make sure that it is accurate and idiomatic."\n\nExample 3: Text generation for text completion Task: Complete a given text\n\nInstructions: The generated text should be coherent and consistent with the input text\n\nPrompt formula: "Complete the following text [insert text] and make sure that it is coherent and consistent with the input text."Chapter 26: Word prediction prompts\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we\'ve explored throughout this book, prompt engineering is a powerful tool to get high-quality answers from language models like ChatGPT. By carefully crafting prompts that incorporate various techniques, we can guide the model to generate text that is tailored to our specific needs and requirements.\n\nIn chapter 2, we looked at how instructions prompts can be used to provide clear and specific guidance to the model. In chapter 3, we explored how role prompts can be used to generate text in a specific voice or style. In chapter 4, we examined how standard prompts can be used as a starting point for fine-tuning the model\'s performance.\n\nWe also looked at several advanced prompt techniques such as Zero, One and Few Shot Prompting, Self-Consistency, Seed-word Prompt, Knowledge Generation prompt, Knowledge Integration prompts, Multiple Choice prompts, Interpretable Soft Prompts, Controlled generation prompts, Question-answering prompts, Summarization prompts, Dialogue prompts, Adversarial prompts, Clustering prompts, Reinforcement learning prompts, Curriculum learning prompts, Sentiment analysis prompts, Named entity recognition prompts, and Text classification prompts Each of these techniques can be used in different ways to\n######################\nOutput:', 'kwargs': {}}

It allows users to control the output of the model and generate text that is tailored to their specific needs.\n\nChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that is capable of generating human-like text. It is built on the transformer architecture, which allows it to handle large amounts of data and generate high-quality text.\n\nHowever, in order to get the best results from ChatGPT, it is important to understand how to properly prompt the model.\n\nPrompting allows users to control the output of the model and generate text that is relevant, accurate, and of high-quality.\n\nWhen working with ChatGPT, it is important to understand its capabilities and limitations.\n\nThe model is capable of generating human-like text, but it may not always produce the desired output without proper guidance.\n\nThis is where prompt engineering comes in, by providing clear and specific instructions, you can guide the model\'s output and ensure that it is relevant.\n\nA prompt formula is a specific format for the prompt, it is generally composed of 3 main elements:\n\ntask: a clear and concise statement of what the prompt is asking the model to generate.\n\ninstructions: the instructions that should be followed by the model when generating text.\n\nrole: the role that the model should take on when generating text.\n\nIn this book, we will explore the various prompt engineering techniques that can be used with ChatGPT. We will discuss the\n\ndifferent types of prompts, as well as how to use them to achieve specific goals you want.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Instructions Prompt Technique Now, let us start by exploring the “instructions prompt technique”\n\nand how it can be used to generate high-quality text from ChatGPT.\n\nThe instructions prompt technique is a way of guiding the output of ChatGPT by providing specific instructions for the model to follow.\n\nThis technique is useful for ensuring that the output is relevant and high-quality.\n\nTo use the instructions prompt technique, you will need to provide a clear and concise task for the model, as well as specific instructions for the model to follow.\n\nFor example, if you are generating customer service responses, you would provide a task such as "generate responses to customer inquiries" and instructions such as "responses should be professional and provide accurate information".\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate [task] following these instructions:\n\n[instructions]"\n\nExamples:\n\nGenerating customer service responses:\n\nTask: Generate\n######################\nOutput:', 'kwargs': {}}

This technique is useful for tasks such as writing essays, poetry, or creative writing.\n\nThe prompt formula for the "Let\'s think about this" prompt is simply the phrase "Let\'s think about this" followed by a topic or question.\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating a reflective essay:\n\nTask: Write a reflective essay on the topic of personal growth Prompt formula: "Let\'s think about this: personal growth"\n\nGenerating a poem:\n\nTask: Write a poem about the changing seasons\n\nPrompt formula: "Let\'s think about this: the changing seasons"\n\nThis prompt is asking for a conversation or discussion about a specific topic or idea. The speaker is inviting ChatGPT to engage in a dialogue about the subject at hand.\n\nThe model is provided with a prompt, which serves as the starting point for the conversation or text generation.\n\nThe model then uses its training data and algorithms to generate a response that is relevant to the prompt. This technique allows ChatGPT to generate contextually appropriate and coherent text based on the provided prompt.\n\nTo use the "Let’s think about this prompt" technique with ChatGPT, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.\n\nIdentify the topic or idea you want to discuss.\n\n2.\n\nFormulate a prompt that clearly states the topic or idea, and starts the conversation or text generation.\n\n3.\n\nPreface the prompt with "Let\'s think about" or "Let\'s discuss"\n\nto indicate that you\'re initiating a conversation or discussion.\n\nHere are a few examples of prompts using this technique: Prompt: "Let\'s think about the impact of climate change on agriculture"\n\nPrompt: "Let\'s discuss the current state of artificial intelligence"\n\nPrompt: "Let\'s talk about the benefits and drawbacks of remote work"\n\nYou can also add a open-ended question, statement or a piece of text that you want the model to continue or build upon.\n\nOnce you provide the prompt, the model will use its training data and algorithms to generate a response that is relevant to the prompt and will continue the conversation in a coherent way.\n\nThis unique prompt helps ChatGPT to give answers in different perspectives and angles, resulting in more dynamic and informative passages.\n\nThe steps to use the prompt are simple and easy to follow, and it can truly make a difference in your writing. Give it a try and see for yourself\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7: Self-Consistency Prompt The Self-Consistency prompt is a technique used to ensure that the output of ChatGPT is consistent with the input provided. This technique is useful for tasks such as fact-checking, data validation, or consistency checking in text generation.\n\nThe prompt formula for the Self-Consistency prompt is the input text followed by the instruction "Please ensure the following text is self-consistent"\n\nAlternatively, the model can be prompted to generate text that is consistent with the provided input.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text Generation\n\nTask: Generate a product review\n\nInstructions: The review should be consistent with the product information provided in the input\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a product review that is consistent with the following product information [insert product information]"\n\nExample 2: Text Summarization\n\nTask: Summarize a news article\n\nInstructions: The summary should be consistent with the information provided in the article\n\nPrompt formula: "Summarize the following news article in a way that is consistent with the information provided [insert news article]"\n\nExample 3: Text Completion\n\nTask: Complete a sentence\n\nInstructions: The completion should be consistent with the context provided in the input\n\nPrompt formula: "Complete the following sentence in a way that is consistent with the context provided [insert sentence]"\n\nExample 4:\n\n1.\n\nFact-checking:\n\nTask: Check for consistency in a given news article Input text: "The article states that the population of the city is 5 million, but later on, it says that the population is 7 million."\n\nPrompt formula: "Please ensure the following text is self-consistent: The article states that the population of the city is 5 million, but later on, it says that the population is 7 million."\n\n\n\n2.\n\nData validation:\n\nTask: Check for consistency in a given data set Input text: "The data shows that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, but the minimum temperature is recorded as 20 degrees."\n\nPrompt formula: "Please ensure the following text is self-consistent: The data shows that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, but the minimum temperature is recorded as 20 degrees."\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Seed-word Prompt\n\nThe Seed-word prompt is a technique used to control the output of ChatGPT by providing it with a specific seed-word or phrase.\n\nThe prompt formula for the Seed-word prompt is the seed-word or phrase followed by the instruction "Please generate text based on the following seed-word"\n\nExamples:\n\nText generation:\n\nTask: Generate a story about a dragon\n\nSeed\n######################\nOutput:', 'kwargs': {}}

This will help to ensure that the output is relevant and high-quality. The instructions prompt technique can be combined together with “role prompting” and “seed-word prompting” as explained in the next chapter to enhance the output of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Role Prompting\n\nThe role prompting technique is a way of guiding the output of ChatGPT by providing a specific role for the model to take on. This technique is useful for generating text that is tailored to a specific context or audience.\n\nTo use the role prompting technique, you will need to provide a clear and specific role for the model to take on. For example, if you are generating customer service responses, you would provide a role such as "customer service representative".\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate [task] as a [role]"\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating customer service responses:\n\nTask: Generate responses to customer inquiries Role: Customer service representative\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate responses to customer inquiries as a customer service representative."\n\nGenerating a legal document:\n\nTask: Generate a legal document\n\nRole: Lawyer\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a legal document as a lawyer."\n\nUsing the role prompting technique with instruction prompting and seed-word prompting will enhance the output of ChatGPT.\n\nHere is an example of how the instruction prompting, role prompting, and seed-word prompting techniques can be combined: Task: Generate a product description for a new smartphone Instructions: The description should be informative, persuasive and highlight the unique features of the smartphone\n\nRole: Marketing representative\n\nSeed-word: "innovative"\n\nPrompt formula: "As a marketing representative, generate an informative, persuasive product description that highlights the innovative features of the new smartphone. The smartphone has the following features [insert your features]”\n\nIn this example, the instruction prompting is used to ensure that the product description is informative and persuasive. The role prompting is used to ensure that the description is written from the perspective of a marketing representative. And the seed-word prompting is used to ensure that the description focuses on the innovative features of the smartphone.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Standard Prompts\n\nStandard prompts are a simple way to guide the output of ChatGPT by providing a specific task for the model to complete.\n\nFor example, if you want to generate a summary of a news article, you would provide a task such as "summarize this news article".\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a [task]"\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating a summary of a news article:\n\nTask: Summarize this news article\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a summary of this news article"\n\n\n\nGenerating a product review:\n\nTask: Write a review of a new smartphone\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a review of this new smartphone"\n\nAlso, Standard prompts can be combined with other techniques like role prompting and seed-word prompting to enhance the output of ChatGPT.\n\nHere is an example of how the standard prompts, role prompting, and seed-word prompting techniques can be combined: Task: Generate a product review for a new laptop Instructions: The review should be objective, informative and highlight the unique features of the laptop\n\nRole: Tech expert\n\nSeed-word: "powerful"\n\nPrompt formula: "As a tech expert, generate an objective and informative product review that highlights the powerful features of the new laptop."\n\nIn this example, the standard prompts technique is used to ensure that the model generates a product review. The role prompting is used to ensure that the review is written from the perspective of a tech expert. And the seedword prompting is used to ensure that the review focuses on the powerful features of the laptop.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Zero, One and Few Shot Prompting Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting are techniques used to generate text from ChatGPT with minimal or no examples. These techniques are useful when there is limited data available for a specific task or when the task is new and not well-defined.\n\nThe zero-shot prompting technique is used when there are no examples available for the task. The model is provided with a general task and it generates text based on its understanding of the task.\n\nThe one-shot prompting technique is used when there is only one example available for the task. The model is provided with the example and generates text based on its understanding of the example.\n\nThe few-shot prompting technique is used when there are a limited number of examples available for the task. The model is provided with the examples and generates text based on its understanding of the examples.\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate text based on [number] examples"\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating a product description for a new product with no examples available:\n\nTask: Write a product description for a new smartwatch Prompt formula: "Generate a product description for this new smartwatch with zero examples"\n\nGenerating a product comparison with one example available:\n\nTask: Compare a new smartphone to the latest iPhone Prompt formula: "Generate a product comparison of this new smartphone with one\n######################\nOutput:', 'kwargs': {}}

It\'s a way to control the model\'s generated text to be related to a certain topic or context.\n\nThe Seed-word prompt can be combined with role prompting and instruction prompting to create more specific and targeted generated text. By providing a seed word or phrase, the model can generate text that is related to that seed word or phrase and by providing information about the desired output and role, the model can generate text in a specific style or tone that is consistent with the role or instructions. This allows for more control over the generated text and can be useful for a wide range of applications Here are Prompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text Generation\n\nTask: Generate a poem\n\nInstructions: The poem should be related to the seed word\n\n"love" and should be written in the style of a sonnet.\n\nRole: Poet\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate a sonnet related to the seed word\n\n\'love\' as a poet"\n\nExample 2: Text Completion\n\nTask: Complete a sentence\n\nInstructions: The completion should be related to the seed word "science" and should be written in the style of a research paper\n\nRole: Researcher\n\nPrompt formula: "Complete the following sentence in a way that is related to the seed word \'science\' and in the style of a research paper as a researcher: [insert sentence]"\n\nExample 3: Text Summarization\n\nTask: Summarize a news article\n\nInstructions: The summary should be related to the seed word\n\n"politics" and should be written in a neutral and unbiased tone Role: Journalist\n\nPrompt formula: "Summarize the following news article in a way that is related to the seed word \'politics\' in a neutral and unbiased tone as a journalist: [insert news article]"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 9: Knowledge Generation prompt The Knowledge Generation prompt is a technique used to elicit new and original information from ChatGPT.\n\nThe prompt formula for the Knowledge Generation prompt is\n\n"Please generate new and original information about X" where X is the topic of interest.\n\nThis is a technique that uses a model\'s pre-existing knowledge to generate new information or to answer a question.\n\nTo use this prompt with ChatGPT, the model should be provided with a question or topic as input, along with a prompt that specifies the task or goal for the generated text. The prompt should include information about the desired output, such as the type of text to be generated and any specific requirements or constraints.\n\nHere are Prompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Knowledge Generation\n\nTask: Generate new information about a specific topic Instructions: The generated information should be accurate and relevant to the topic\n\nPrompt formula: "Generate new and accurate information about [specific topic] "\n\nExample 2: Question Answering\n\nTask: Answer a question\n\nInstructions: The answer should be accurate and relevant to the question\n\nPrompt formula: "Answer the following question: [insert question]"\n\nExample 3: Knowledge Integration\n\nTask: Integrate new information with the existing knowledge\n\nInstructions: The integration should be accurate and relevant to the topic\n\nPrompt formula: "Integrate the following information with the existing knowledge about [specific topic]: [insert new information]"\n\n\n\nExample 4: Data Analysis:\n\nTask: Generate insights about customer behavior from a given dataset\n\nPrompt formula: "Please generate new and original information about customer behavior from this dataset"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 10: Knowledge Integration prompts This technique uses a model\'s pre-existing knowledge to integrate new information or to connect different pieces of information.\n\nThis technique is useful for combining existing knowledge with new information to generate a more comprehensive understanding of a specific topic.\n\nHow to use it with ChatGPT: The model should be provided with a new information and the existing knowledge as input, along with a prompt that specifies the task or goal for the generated text. The prompt should include information about the desired output, such as the type of text to be generated and any specific requirements or constraints.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Knowledge Integration\n\nTask: Integrate new information with the existing knowledge Instructions: The integration should be accurate and relevant to the topic\n\nPrompt formula: "Integrate the following information with the existing knowledge about [specific topic]: [insert new information]"\n\nExample 2: Connecting pieces of information\n\nTask: Connect different pieces of information\n\nInstructions: The connections should be relevant and logical Prompt formula: "Connect the following pieces of information in a way that is relevant and logical: [insert information 1] [insert information 2]"\n\nExample 3: Updating existing knowledge\n\nTask: Update existing knowledge with new information\n\nInstructions: The updated information should be accurate and relevant\n\nPrompt formula: "Update the existing knowledge about\n\n[specific topic] with the following information: [insert new information]"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 11: Multiple Choice prompts This technique presents a model with a question or task and a set of predefined options as potential answers.\n\nThis technique is useful for generating text that is limited to a specific set of options and can be used for question-ans\n######################\nOutput:', 'kwargs': {}}
