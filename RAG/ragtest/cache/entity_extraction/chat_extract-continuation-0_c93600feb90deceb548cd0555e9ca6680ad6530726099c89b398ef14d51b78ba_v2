This technique is useful for tasks such as writing essays, poetry, or creative writing.\n\nThe prompt formula for the \"Let's think about this\" prompt is simply the phrase \"Let's think about this\" followed by a topic or question.\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating a reflective essay:\n\nTask: Write a reflective essay on the topic of personal growth Prompt formula: \"Let's think about this: personal growth\"\n\nGenerating a poem:\n\nTask: Write a poem about the changing seasons\n\nPrompt formula: \"Let's think about this: the changing seasons\"\n\nThis prompt is asking for a conversation or discussion about a specific topic or idea. The speaker is inviting ChatGPT to engage in a dialogue about the subject at hand.\n\nThe model is provided with a prompt, which serves as the starting point for the conversation or text generation.\n\nThe model then uses its training data and algorithms to generate a response that is relevant to the prompt. This technique allows ChatGPT to generate contextually appropriate and coherent text based on the provided prompt.\n\nTo use the \"Let’s think about this prompt\" technique with ChatGPT, you can follow these steps:\n\n1.\n\nIdentify the topic or idea you want to discuss.\n\n2.\n\nFormulate a prompt that clearly states the topic or idea, and starts the conversation or text generation.\n\n3.\n\nPreface the prompt with \"Let's think about\" or \"Let's discuss\"\n\nto indicate that you're initiating a conversation or discussion.\n\nHere are a few examples of prompts using this technique: Prompt: \"Let's think about the impact of climate change on agriculture\"\n\nPrompt: \"Let's discuss the current state of artificial intelligence\"\n\nPrompt: \"Let's talk about the benefits and drawbacks of remote work\"\n\nYou can also add a open-ended question, statement or a piece of text that you want the model to continue or build upon.\n\nOnce you provide the prompt, the model will use its training data and algorithms to generate a response that is relevant to the prompt and will continue the conversation in a coherent way.\n\nThis unique prompt helps ChatGPT to give answers in different perspectives and angles, resulting in more dynamic and informative passages.\n\nThe steps to use the prompt are simple and easy to follow, and it can truly make a difference in your writing. Give it a try and see for yourself\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 7: Self-Consistency Prompt The Self-Consistency prompt is a technique used to ensure that the output of ChatGPT is consistent with the input provided. This technique is useful for tasks such as fact-checking, data validation, or consistency checking in text generation.\n\nThe prompt formula for the Self-Consistency prompt is the input text followed by the instruction \"Please ensure the following text is self-consistent\"\n\nAlternatively, the model can be prompted to generate text that is consistent with the provided input.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text Generation\n\nTask: Generate a product review\n\nInstructions: The review should be consistent with the product information provided in the input\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate a product review that is consistent with the following product information [insert product information]\"\n\nExample 2: Text Summarization\n\nTask: Summarize a news article\n\nInstructions: The summary should be consistent with the information provided in the article\n\nPrompt formula: \"Summarize the following news article in a way that is consistent with the information provided [insert news article]\"\n\nExample 3: Text Completion\n\nTask: Complete a sentence\n\nInstructions: The completion should be consistent with the context provided in the input\n\nPrompt formula: \"Complete the following sentence in a way that is consistent with the context provided [insert sentence]\"\n\nExample 4:\n\n1.\n\nFact-checking:\n\nTask: Check for consistency in a given news article Input text: \"The article states that the population of the city is 5 million, but later on, it says that the population is 7 million.\"\n\nPrompt formula: \"Please ensure the following text is self-consistent: The article states that the population of the city is 5 million, but later on, it says that the population is 7 million.\"\n\n\n\n2.\n\nData validation:\n\nTask: Check for consistency in a given data set Input text: \"The data shows that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, but the minimum temperature is recorded as 20 degrees.\"\n\nPrompt formula: \"Please ensure the following text is self-consistent: The data shows that the average temperature in July is 30 degrees, but the minimum temperature is recorded as 20 degrees.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 8: Seed-word Prompt\n\nThe Seed-word prompt is a technique used to control the output of ChatGPT by providing it with a specific seed-word or phrase.\n\nThe prompt formula for the Seed-word prompt is the seed-word or phrase followed by the instruction \"Please generate text based on the following seed-word\"\n\nExamples:\n\nText generation:\n\nTask: Generate a story about a dragon\n\nSeed\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>ChatGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a language model AI developed by OpenAI)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>OpenAI<|>ORGANIZATION<|>OpenAI is the organization behind the development of ChatGPT)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Chapter 6<|>EVENT<|>Chapter 6 is a section in the prompt guide)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Chapter 7<|>EVENT<|>Chapter 7 is a section in the prompt guide)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>Chapter 8<|>EVENT<|>Chapter 8 is a section in the prompt guide)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>ChatGPT<|>OpenAI<|>OpenAI developed ChatGPT<|>8)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Chapter 6<|>ChatGPT<|>Chapter 6 explains the \"Let's think about this\" prompt technique used by ChatGPT<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Chapter 7<|>ChatGPT<|>Chapter 7 explains the \"Self-Consistency\" prompt technique used by ChatGPT<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>Chapter 8<|>ChatGPT<|>Chapter 8 explains the \"Seed-word\" prompt technique used by ChatGPT<|>7)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
