The model can generate text that is limited to the predefined options.\n\nTo use the multiple-choice prompt with ChatGPT, the model should be provided with a question or task as input, along with a set of predefined options as potential answers. The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the type of text to be generated and any specific requirements or constraints.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Question Answering\n\nTask: Answer a multiple-choice question\n\nInstructions: The answer should be one of the predefined options\n\nPrompt formula: \"Answer the following question by selecting one of the following options: [insert question] [insert option 1]\n\n[insert option 2] [insert option 3]\"\n\nExample 2: Text completion\n\nTask: Complete a sentence with one of the predefined options Instructions: The completion should be one of the predefined options\n\nPrompt formula: \"Complete the following sentence by selecting one of the following options: [insert sentence] [insert option 1] [insert option 2] [insert option 3]\"\n\nExample 3: Sentiment analysis\n\nTask: Classify a text as positive, neutral or negative\n\nInstructions: The classification should be one of the predefined options\n\nPrompt formula: \"Classify the following text as positive, neutral or negative by selecting one of the following options: [insert text]\n\n[positive] [neutral] [negative]\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 12: Interpretable Soft Prompts Interpretable soft prompts is a technique that allows to control the model's generated text while providing some flexibility to the model.\n\nIt is done by providing the model with a set of controlled inputs and some additional information about the desired output. This technique allows for more interpretable and controllable generated text.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text generation\n\nTask: Generate a story\n\nInstructions: The story should be based on a given set of characters and a specific theme\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate a story based on the following characters: [insert characters] and the theme: [insert theme]\"\n\nExample 2: Text completion\n\nTask: Complete a sentence\n\nInstructions: The completion should be in the style of a specific author\n\nPrompt formula: \"Complete the following sentence in the style of [specific author]: [insert sentence]\"\n\nExample 3: Language modeling\n\nTask: Generate text in a specific style\n\nInstructions: The text should be in the style of a specific period Prompt formula: \"Generate text in the style of [specific period]:\n\n[insert context]\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 13: Controlled Generation prompts Controlled generation prompts are techniques that allows to generate text with a high level of control over the output.\n\nThis is achieved by providing the model with a specific set of inputs, such as a template, a specific vocabulary, or a set of constraints, that can be used to guide the generation process.\n\nHere are some Prompt Examples and their Formula: Example 1: Text generation\n\nTask: Generate a story\n\nInstructions: The story should be based on a specific template Prompt formula: \"Generate a story based on the following template: [insert template]\"\n\nExample 2: Text completion\n\nTask: Complete a sentence\n\nInstructions: The completion should use a specific vocabulary Prompt formula: \"Complete the following sentence using the following vocabulary: [insert vocabulary]: [insert sentence]\"\n\nExample 3: Language modeling\n\nTask: Generate text in a specific style\n\nInstructions: The text should follow a specific set of grammatical rules\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate text that follows the following grammatical rules: [insert rules]: [insert context]\"\n\nBy providing the model with a specific set of inputs that can be used to guide the generation process, controlled generation prompts allows more controllable and predictable generated text\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 14: Question-answering prompts Question-answering prompts is a technique that allows a model to generate text that answers a specific question or task. This is achieved by providing the model with a question or task as input, along with any additional information that may be relevant to the question or task.\n\nSome Prompt Examples and their Formula are;\n\nExample 1: Factual question answering\n\nTask: Answer a factual question\n\nInstructions: The answer should be accurate and relevant Prompt formula: \"Answer the following factual question: [insert question]\"\n\nExample 2: Definition\n\nTask: Provide the definition of a word\n\nInstructions: The definition should be precise Prompt formula: \"Define the following word: [insert word]\"\n\nExample 3: Information Retrieval\n\nTask: Retrieve information from a specific source Instructions: The retrieved information should be relevant Prompt formula: \"Retrieve information about [specific topic]\n\nfrom the following source: [insert source]\"\n\nThis can be useful for tasks such as question-answering and information retrieval.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 15: Summarization prompts Summarization prompts is a technique that allows a model to generate a shorter version of a given text while retaining its main ideas and information.\n\nThis is achieved by providing the model with a longer text as input and asking it to generate a summary of that text.\n\nThis technique is useful for tasks such as text summarization and information compression.\n\nHow to use it with ChatGPT: The model should be provided with a longer text as input and asked to generate a summary of that text.
