This will help to ensure that the output is relevant and high-quality. The instructions prompt technique can be combined together with “role prompting” and “seed-word prompting” as explained in the next chapter to enhance the output of ChatGPT.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 3: Role Prompting\n\nThe role prompting technique is a way of guiding the output of ChatGPT by providing a specific role for the model to take on. This technique is useful for generating text that is tailored to a specific context or audience.\n\nTo use the role prompting technique, you will need to provide a clear and specific role for the model to take on. For example, if you are generating customer service responses, you would provide a role such as \"customer service representative\".\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate [task] as a [role]\"\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating customer service responses:\n\nTask: Generate responses to customer inquiries Role: Customer service representative\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate responses to customer inquiries as a customer service representative.\"\n\nGenerating a legal document:\n\nTask: Generate a legal document\n\nRole: Lawyer\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate a legal document as a lawyer.\"\n\nUsing the role prompting technique with instruction prompting and seed-word prompting will enhance the output of ChatGPT.\n\nHere is an example of how the instruction prompting, role prompting, and seed-word prompting techniques can be combined: Task: Generate a product description for a new smartphone Instructions: The description should be informative, persuasive and highlight the unique features of the smartphone\n\nRole: Marketing representative\n\nSeed-word: \"innovative\"\n\nPrompt formula: \"As a marketing representative, generate an informative, persuasive product description that highlights the innovative features of the new smartphone. The smartphone has the following features [insert your features]”\n\nIn this example, the instruction prompting is used to ensure that the product description is informative and persuasive. The role prompting is used to ensure that the description is written from the perspective of a marketing representative. And the seed-word prompting is used to ensure that the description focuses on the innovative features of the smartphone.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 4: Standard Prompts\n\nStandard prompts are a simple way to guide the output of ChatGPT by providing a specific task for the model to complete.\n\nFor example, if you want to generate a summary of a news article, you would provide a task such as \"summarize this news article\".\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate a [task]\"\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating a summary of a news article:\n\nTask: Summarize this news article\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate a summary of this news article\"\n\n\n\nGenerating a product review:\n\nTask: Write a review of a new smartphone\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate a review of this new smartphone\"\n\nAlso, Standard prompts can be combined with other techniques like role prompting and seed-word prompting to enhance the output of ChatGPT.\n\nHere is an example of how the standard prompts, role prompting, and seed-word prompting techniques can be combined: Task: Generate a product review for a new laptop Instructions: The review should be objective, informative and highlight the unique features of the laptop\n\nRole: Tech expert\n\nSeed-word: \"powerful\"\n\nPrompt formula: \"As a tech expert, generate an objective and informative product review that highlights the powerful features of the new laptop.\"\n\nIn this example, the standard prompts technique is used to ensure that the model generates a product review. The role prompting is used to ensure that the review is written from the perspective of a tech expert. And the seedword prompting is used to ensure that the review focuses on the powerful features of the laptop.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 5: Zero, One and Few Shot Prompting Zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting are techniques used to generate text from ChatGPT with minimal or no examples. These techniques are useful when there is limited data available for a specific task or when the task is new and not well-defined.\n\nThe zero-shot prompting technique is used when there are no examples available for the task. The model is provided with a general task and it generates text based on its understanding of the task.\n\nThe one-shot prompting technique is used when there is only one example available for the task. The model is provided with the example and generates text based on its understanding of the example.\n\nThe few-shot prompting technique is used when there are a limited number of examples available for the task. The model is provided with the examples and generates text based on its understanding of the examples.\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate text based on [number] examples\"\n\nExample:\n\nGenerating a product description for a new product with no examples available:\n\nTask: Write a product description for a new smartwatch Prompt formula: \"Generate a product description for this new smartwatch with zero examples\"\n\nGenerating a product comparison with one example available:\n\nTask: Compare a new smartphone to the latest iPhone Prompt formula: \"Generate a product comparison of this new smartphone with one\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a language model designed to generate text based on given prompts and instructions)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE<|>PERSON<|>A person who provides responses to customer inquiries)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAWYER<|>PERSON<|>A legal professional who can generate legal documents)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>MARKETING REPRESENTATIVE<|>PERSON<|>A person who can generate product descriptions and reviews from a marketing perspective)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>SMARTPHONE<|>EVENT<|>A new product that needs a product description and comparison)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>LAPTOP<|>EVENT<|>A new product that needs a product review)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>CUSTOMER SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE<|>CHATGPT<|>Customer service representatives can use ChatGPT to generate responses to customer inquiries<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAWYER<|>CHATGPT<|>Lawyers can use ChatGPT to generate legal documents<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>MARKETING REPRESENTATIVE<|>CHATGPT<|>Marketing representatives can use ChatGPT to generate product descriptions and reviews<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>SMARTPHONE<|>CHATGPT<|>ChatGPT can generate a product description for a new smartphone<|>9)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>LAPTOP<|>CHATGPT<|>ChatGPT can generate a product review for a new laptop<|>9)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
