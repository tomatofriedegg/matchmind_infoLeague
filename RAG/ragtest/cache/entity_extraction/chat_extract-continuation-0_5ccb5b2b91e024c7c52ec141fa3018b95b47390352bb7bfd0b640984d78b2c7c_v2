This technique is useful for tasks such as natural language processing, text analytics, and sentiment analysis.\n\nIt's important to note that Text classification is different from sentiment analysis. Sentiment analysis specifically focus on determining the sentiment or emotion expressed in text.\n\nThis could include determining whether the text expresses a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment. Sentiment analysis is often used in the context of customer reviews, social media posts, and other forms of text where the sentiment expressed is important.\n\nTo use text classification prompts with ChatGPT, the model should be provided with a piece of text and asked to classify it based on predefined categories or labels. The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the number of classes or categories, and any specific requirements or constraints.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text classification of customer reviews Task: Classify customer reviews into different categories such as electronics, clothing and furniture\n\nInstructions: The model should classify the reviews based on their content\n\nPrompt formula: \"Perform text classification on the following customer reviews [insert reviews] and classify them into different categories such as electronics, clothing and furniture based on their content.\"\n\nExample 2: Text classification of news articles Task: Classify news articles into different categories such as sports, politics, and entertainment\n\nInstructions: The model should classify the articles based on their content\n\nPrompt formula: \"Perform text classification on the following news articles [insert articles] and classify them into different categories such as sports, politics, and entertainment based on their content.\"\n\nExample 3: Text classification of emails\n\nTask: Classify emails into different categories such as spam, important, or urgent\n\nInstructions: The model should classify the emails based on their content and sender\n\nPrompt formula: \"Perform text classification on the following emails [insert emails] and classify them into different categories such as spam, important, or urgent based on their content and sender.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 24: Text generation prompts Text generation prompts are related to several other prompt techniques mentioned in this book, such as: Zero, One and Few Shot Prompting, Controlled generation prompts, Translation prompts, Language modeling prompts, Sentence completion prompts.\n\nAll these prompts are related because they all involve generating text, but they differ in the way the text is generated and the specific requirements or constraints that are placed on the generated text.\n\nText generation prompts can be used to fine-tune a pre-trained model or to train a new model for specific tasks.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Text generation for story writing\n\nTask: Generate a story based on a given prompt Instructions: The story should be at least 1000 words and include a specific set of characters and a plot Prompt formula: \"Generate a story of at least 1000 words, including characters [insert characters] and a plot [insert plot]\n\nbased on the following prompt [insert prompt].\"\n\nExample 2: Text generation for language translation Task: Translate a given text into another language Instructions: The translation should be accurate and idiomatic Prompt formula: \"Translate the following text [insert text] into\n\n[insert target language] and make sure that it is accurate and idiomatic.\"\n\nExample 3: Text generation for text completion Task: Complete a given text\n\nInstructions: The generated text should be coherent and consistent with the input text\n\nPrompt formula: \"Complete the following text [insert text] and make sure that it is coherent and consistent with the input text.\"Chapter 26: Word prediction prompts\n\n\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\nAs we've explored throughout this book, prompt engineering is a powerful tool to get high-quality answers from language models like ChatGPT. By carefully crafting prompts that incorporate various techniques, we can guide the model to generate text that is tailored to our specific needs and requirements.\n\nIn chapter 2, we looked at how instructions prompts can be used to provide clear and specific guidance to the model. In chapter 3, we explored how role prompts can be used to generate text in a specific voice or style. In chapter 4, we examined how standard prompts can be used as a starting point for fine-tuning the model's performance.\n\nWe also looked at several advanced prompt techniques such as Zero, One and Few Shot Prompting, Self-Consistency, Seed-word Prompt, Knowledge Generation prompt, Knowledge Integration prompts, Multiple Choice prompts, Interpretable Soft Prompts, Controlled generation prompts, Question-answering prompts, Summarization prompts, Dialogue prompts, Adversarial prompts, Clustering prompts, Reinforcement learning prompts, Curriculum learning prompts, Sentiment analysis prompts, Named entity recognition prompts, and Text classification prompts Each of these techniques can be used in different ways to\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant",
