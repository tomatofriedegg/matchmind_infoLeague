The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the desired length of the summary and any specific requirements or constraints.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Article summarization\n\nTask: Summarize a news article\n\nInstructions: The summary should be a brief overview of the main points of the article\n\nPrompt formula: \"Summarize the following news article in one short sentence: [insert article]\"\n\nExample 2: Meeting notes\n\nTask: Summarize a meeting transcript\n\nInstructions: The summary should highlight the main decisions and actions from the meeting\n\nPrompt formula: \"Summarize the following meeting transcript by listing the main decisions and actions taken: [insert transcript]\"\n\nExample 3: Book Summary\n\nTask: Summarize a book\n\nInstructions: The summary should be a brief overview of the main points of the book\n\nPrompt formula: \"Summarize the following book in one short paragraph: [insert book title]\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 16: Dialogue prompts\n\nDialogue prompts is a technique that allows a model to generate text that simulates a conversation between two or more entities. By providing the model with a context and a set of characters or entities, along with their roles and backgrounds, and asking the model to generate dialogue between them\n\nTherefore, the model should be provided with a context and a set of characters or entities, along with their roles and backgrounds. The model should also be provided with information about the desired output, such as the type of conversation or dialogue and any specific requirements or constraints.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Dialogue generation\n\nTask: Generate a conversation between two characters Instructions: The conversation should be natural and relevant to the given context\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate a conversation between the following characters [insert characters] in the following context\n\n[insert context]\"\n\nExample 2: Story writing\n\nTask: Generate a dialogue in a story\n\nInstructions: The dialogue should be consistent with the characters and events of the story\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate a dialogue between the following characters [insert characters] in the following story [insert story]\"\n\nExample 3: Chatbot development\n\nTask: Generate a dialogue for a customer service chatbot Instructions: The dialogue should be professional and provide accurate information\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate a professional and accurate dialogue for a customer service chatbot, when the customer asks about [insert topic]\"\n\nHence this technique is useful for tasks such as dialogue generation, story writing, and chatbot development.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 17: Adversarial prompts Adversarial prompts is a technique that allows a model to generate text that is resistant to certain types of attacks or biases. This technique can be used to train models that are more robust and resistant to certain types of attacks or biases.\n\nTo use adversarial prompts with ChatGPT, the model should be provided with a prompt that is designed to be difficult for the model to generate text that is consistent with the desired output. The prompt should also include information about the desired output, such as the type of text to be generated and any specific requirements or constraints.\n\nPrompt Examples and their Formula:\n\nExample 1: Adversarial prompt for text classification Task: Generate text that is classified as a specific label Instructions: The generated text should be difficult to classify as the specific label\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate text that is difficult to classify as\n\n[insert label]\"\n\nExample 2: Adversarial prompt for sentiment analysis Task: Generate text that is difficult to classify as a specific sentiment\n\nInstructions: The generated text should be difficult to classify as the specific sentiment\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate text that is difficult to classify as having the sentiment of [insert sentiment]\"\n\nExample 3: Adversarial prompt for language translation Task: Generate text that is difficult to translate Instructions: The generated text should be difficult to translate to the target language\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate text that is difficult to translate to\n\n[insert target language]\"\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 18: Clustering prompts Clustering prompts is a technique that allows a model to group similar data points together based on certain characteristics or features.\n\nThis is achieved by providing the model with a set of data points and asking it to group them into clusters based on certain characteristics or features.\n\nThis technique is useful for tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, and natural language processing.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow to use it with ChatGPT:\n\nThe model should be provided with a set of data points and asked to group them into clusters based on certain characteristics or features.
