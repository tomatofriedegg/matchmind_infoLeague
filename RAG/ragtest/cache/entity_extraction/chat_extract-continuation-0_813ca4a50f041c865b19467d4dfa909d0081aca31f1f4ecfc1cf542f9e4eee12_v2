ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that is capable of generating human-like text.\n\nHowever, it is vital to understand the right way to ask ChatGPT in order to get the high-quality outputs we desire.\n\nAnd that is the purpose of this book. Whether you are a normal person, a researcher, a developer, or simply someone who wants to use ChatGPT as his personal assistant in your field, this book is written for you.\n\nI have used simple language with on-point practical explanations, together with examples and prompt formulas on every prompt technique. With this book, you'll learn how to use prompt engineering techniques to control the output of ChatGPT and generate text that is tailored to your specific needs.\n\nThroughout this book, we also provide examples of how to combine different prompt techniques to achieve more specific outcomes.\n\n\n\nI hope that you will find this book informative and enjoyable as much as I enjoyed writing it.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 1: Introduction to Prompt Engineering Techniques\n\nWhat is Prompt engineering?\n\nPrompt engineering is the process of creating prompts or asking or instructions that guide the output of a language model like ChatGPT. It allows users to control the output of the model and generate text that is tailored to their specific needs.\n\nChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that is capable of generating human-like text. It is built on the transformer architecture, which allows it to handle large amounts of data and generate high-quality text.\n\nHowever, in order to get the best results from ChatGPT, it is important to understand how to properly prompt the model.\n\nPrompting allows users to control the output of the model and generate text that is relevant, accurate, and of high-quality.\n\nWhen working with ChatGPT, it is important to understand its capabilities and limitations.\n\nThe model is capable of generating human-like text, but it may not always produce the desired output without proper guidance.\n\nThis is where prompt engineering comes in, by providing clear and specific instructions, you can guide the model's output and ensure that it is relevant.\n\nA prompt formula is a specific format for the prompt, it is generally composed of 3 main elements:\n\ntask: a clear and concise statement of what the prompt is asking the model to generate.\n\ninstructions: the instructions that should be followed by the model when generating text.\n\nrole: the role that the model should take on when generating text.\n\nIn this book, we will explore the various prompt engineering techniques that can be used with ChatGPT. We will discuss the\n\ndifferent types of prompts, as well as how to use them to achieve specific goals you want.\n\n\n\n\n\nChapter 2: Instructions Prompt Technique Now, let us start by exploring the “instructions prompt technique”\n\nand how it can be used to generate high-quality text from ChatGPT.\n\nThe instructions prompt technique is a way of guiding the output of ChatGPT by providing specific instructions for the model to follow.\n\nThis technique is useful for ensuring that the output is relevant and high-quality.\n\nTo use the instructions prompt technique, you will need to provide a clear and concise task for the model, as well as specific instructions for the model to follow.\n\nFor example, if you are generating customer service responses, you would provide a task such as \"generate responses to customer inquiries\" and instructions such as \"responses should be professional and provide accurate information\".\n\nPrompt formula: \"Generate [task] following these instructions:\n\n[instructions]\"\n\nExamples:\n\nGenerating customer service responses:\n\nTask: Generate\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "(\"entity\"<|>CHATGPT<|>ORGANIZATION<|>ChatGPT is a state-of-the-art language model that is capable of generating human-like text)\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>IBRAHIM JOHN<|>PERSON<|>Ibrahim John is the author of the book \"The Art of Asking ChatGPT for High-Quality Answers: A complete Guide to Prompt Engineering Techniques\")\n##\n(\"entity\"<|>NZUNDA TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED<|>ORGANIZATION<|>Nzunda Technologies Limited is the publisher of the book \"The Art of Asking ChatGPT for High-Quality Answers: A complete Guide to Prompt Engineering Techniques\")\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>IBRAHIM JOHN<|>CHATGPT<|>Ibrahim John wrote a book about using ChatGPT for high-quality answers<|>7)\n##\n(\"relationship\"<|>NZUNDA TECHNOLOGIES LIMITED<|>IBRAHIM JOHN<|>Nzunda Technologies Limited published Ibrahim John's book<|>6)\n<|COMPLETE|>"}, {"content": "MANY entities and relationships were missed in the last extraction.
